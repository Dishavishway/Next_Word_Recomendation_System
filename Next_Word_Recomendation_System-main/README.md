# Next Word Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Next Word Recommendation System** predicts the next word based on a given sequence of input words. This system is particularly useful for applications like text auto-completion, chatbots, and other predictive text interfaces.

## Features
- Suggests the next word in a sequence of words.
- Utilizes N-gram models for word prediction.
- Handles large text datasets for accurate predictions.
  Workflow
## The Next Word Recommendation System is built using the following steps:

### Loading and Exploring the Dataset:

Load the dataset containing dialogues or text data.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
### Creating N-grams of the Dialogue:

Generate N-grams from the dataset. N-grams are continuous sequences of N items from a given sample of text.
### Building the N-gram Language Model:

Create an N-gram model that captures the statistical properties of the text data, allowing for next-word predictions.
### Predicting the Next Word:

Use the N-gram model to predict the next word based on the input sequence provided by the user.

## Prerequisites
To run the project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `re` (Regular Expressions)
- `pickle`
- `tqdm` (for progress tracking)

You can install the required Python packages with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy tqdm
